Seems like some audio are injected somehow. Needs to be investigated.

Supposedly subconscious-induced. Needs to be investigated.

Some mouvements will trigger either thought or audio injections.

Needs to be investigated.

Initially thought it was happening only on 127.0.0.1, but it seems it's on 0.0.0.0.

There used to be empty streets; now the streets are busier but the UX remains the same.

> Use arrow keys (↑, ↓, ←, →) to update x, y, z coordinates; press Enter for a new line, and Ctrl+C to exit.

This suppose I would stay in the same place and keep recording. I moved around. Making it a mobile app using GPS coordinates on top would make for a better visualization.

Maybe it would put some light on some entries being triggered based on the current "context".

Each entry triggers a different feeling, which could be linked to a "weight".

It would be great to be able to estimate/calculate the effect of the entries on the "[player](https://archive.is/OF6Cx)" (or should we talk about "[lonely people](https://www.psypost.org/lonely-individuals-tend-to-think-and-talk-in-an-unusual-way-study-finds/#google_vignette)"?) well-being. This came up after starting to notice really embarassing [OCDs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYm8kdGmpeA).
