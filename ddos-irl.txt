Family couldn't help obtain an ID somehow; I tried to find people that would help me obtain a certificate of residency but only managed to, somehow again, after stripping myself of my computer in Moulay Abdellah. Documents have been exchanged with a "family" in Ouled Ghadbane to start the procedure but the situation was too insane to complete.

Any way, time is being spent trying to cover "up".

Everybody seem aware of the situation, pronouncing the name of my kid to trigger me.
